User Guide and API Documentation
=================================

.. note::
   This is the `sphinx` documentation for the Python Package Template repository.
   It contains a suggested structure for the documentation of a Python package.
   The relevant files give short descriptions of what you might want to include in
   these files.

   Your goal for the documentation is to make the code repository self-contained.
   This means that the repository contains everything a developer needs to know:

   * Who wrote the code?
   * Why was the code written?
   * How to install the code?
   * How is the code designed?
   * How is the code deployed?
   * How is the code tested?
   * How to use the final application?
